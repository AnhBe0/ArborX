Contributing
------------

Contributing to ArborX is easy. Just send us a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
When you send your request, make `master` the destination branch on the
[ArborX repository](https://github.com/ArborX/ArborX).

Your pull request must pass ArborX's tests. We enforce these guidelines with Jenkins CI.
